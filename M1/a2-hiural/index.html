                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    "<strong>index.html</strong>" is a common default name for the "home" page of a website hosted on an Apache web server, which is the type of server used by OSU's Engineering server. This means that when
                     a user navigates to a directory on an Apache web server, such as OSU's Engineering server, without specifying a particular file in the URL, the server will automatically look for a file named
                      "<strong>index.html</strong>" in that directory and serve it as the default home page to the user's browser. It's worth noting that on other types of web servers, such as Microsoft's .NET platform,
                       the default name for the homepage might be "<strong>default.html</strong>" instead of "<strong>index.html</strong>". Additionally, some servers may also look for other file names like 
                       "<strong>index.js</strong>" or "<strong>index.php</strong>" as the default home page depending on the server's configuration and the programming language used for the website. This default file,
                        whatever its name may be, plays an important role in website organization and navigation as it allows users to easily access the content they are looking for and ensures that the website's file
                         structure remains organized.     
                <p>
                    
                    When accessing a webpage from a remote web server, the browser sends an HTTP request that includes various details in the response headers, such as <strong>status codes</strong> indicating the outcome
                     of the request. The web server listens on specific port numbers, such as <strong>port 80</strong> for HTTP or <strong>port 443</strong> for HTTPS, for incoming requests. In contrast, when accessing
                      a webpage locally on a computer, the browser reads files directly from the local file system, without making a request to a remote web server, so there is no need for ports or status codes. 
                      Furthermore, when accessing a webpage from a remote web server, there are typically more details available in the response headers and request headers, which can be explored using the browser's 
                      Developer Tools. These details provide insights into the network activity and information exchanged between the browser and the remote web server during the request and response process. Reviewing
                       these details can help in understanding the differences in how web servers and browsers handle requests and responses when accessing webpages locally versus from a remote web server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    When accessing a webpage from a web server, the server can provide a <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file in the response header, which allows the browser to display the website's icon in the address bar. 
                    This <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file is typically provided automatically by the web server, such as the OSU server in this case. Similarly, <strong>main.css</strong> and <strong>main.js</strong> files 
                    may be included in the server's response to provide CSS and JavaScript code for styling and interactivity. However, when accessing a webpage locally, these files may not be present unless manually included
                     in the local files, as the local file system does not have the capability to dynamically provide them like a web server. The presence or absence of these files, as well as specific response codes like 
                     <strong>404 (Not Found)</strong>, which indicate whether a requested resource was found on the web server, may vary depending on server configuration and website setup. It's important to note that the 
                     status code 404 is related to the existence of the files and not their use in the file, and it is one of the many response codes used by web servers to communicate the status of a request made by the browser.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    In the given URL "https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~hiural/a1-hiural/", the <strong>scheme</strong> is "https", which defines the protocol used to access the resource on the web. The <strong>subdomain</strong>
                     is "web.engr" and the <strong>domain</strong> is "oregonstate.edu", which together make up the <strong>host domain</strong>, indicating the address of the web server that hosts the webpage. The "~hiural" 
                     is the <strong>subdirectory</strong> or <strong>subdomain</strong>, which is a directory within the server's root directory that points to a specific user's home directory. Finally, "a1-hiural" is the
                      <strong>resource</strong>, which refers to a specific file or directory within the subdirectory. In this case, it could be a webpage, an image, a stylesheet, or any other resource that the server can serve.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frontend design</strong> encompasses the visual and interactive aspects of creating a website or web application. It involves designing the graphical user interface (GUI), which includes the layout,
                     color scheme, typography, imagery, and navigation systems. The goal of frontend design is to create an engaging and intuitive experience for users, ensuring that the website or web application is visually
                      appealing, easy to navigate, and user-friendly. Frontend design also considers the latest trends and best practices in the field to stay up-to-date with user expectations. <strong>Usability</strong> is
                       a crucial aspect of frontend design, as it measures the quality of the user experience when interacting with the website or web application. A well-designed frontend should prioritize usability, ensuring
                        that users can easily understand and use the website or web application to achieve their goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Page layout tags</strong>, including <strong>block-level elements</strong>, <strong>headlines</strong>, <strong>paragraphs</strong>, and others, serve a critical purpose in structuring and organizing content within a webpage. These tags are employed to create distinct sections and facilitate the clear demarcation and separation of different parts of a webpage. Browsers typically display these page layout tags with a <strong>newline</strong> before and after the element, visually signifying a block of content. Despite lacking inherent visual styles, these tags play a pivotal role in aiding machines, such as search engine robots and screen readers, in comprehending the structure and components of a webpage. For instance, the introduction of new names for areas of a page, such as <strong>header</strong>, <strong>nav</strong>, <strong>main</strong>, <strong>section</strong>, <strong>aside</strong>, and <strong>footer</strong>, in HTML5 provides meaningful information to machines about the purpose and content of each section. This, in turn, contributes to improved accessibility and overall understanding of the webpage's structure for both human users and automated systems.

                    <strong>Text anchors</strong> and <strong>navigation</strong> play distinct roles in web design, serving different purposes. <strong>Text anchors</strong> are utilized to create hyperlinks within a webpage, 
                    enabling users to seamlessly navigate to specific content on the same page. On the other hand, <strong>navigation</strong> facilitates movement between different pages or sections of a website, providing users
                     with a structured means of accessing different areas of the website. <strong>Text anchors</strong> are typically integrated within paragraphs or other HTML elements, providing intra-page navigation, while 
                     <strong>navigation</strong> is typically positioned at strategic locations on a webpage, such as the top, bottom, or side, to enable inter-page navigation. Both <strong>text anchors</strong> and 
                     <strong>navigation</strong> are crucial elements in enhancing the user experience, ensuring easy and efficient access to content within a website.
